# radixal-coding-python
## The Goal:
Write a program in Python that counts backwards from value provided by user to 1 and prints:
- "Agile" if the number is divisible by 5,
- "Software" if the number is divisible by 3,
- "Testing" if the number is divisible by both, or prints just the number if none of those cases are true.

## The script will:
- Print "Testing" only if ALL numbers from isDivisibleBy list are divisors.
- Print "Agile" or "Software" based on tuple's value in isDivisibleBy list respectively.
- Any number of tuples in isDivisibleBy list can be provided.

## Usage:
```
git clone git@github.com:matuspetrik/rdx-coding-python.git
cd rdx-coding-python
source env.sh
python main.py
```
